These problems that need to predict are not a pre-defined category but an arbitrary real number. The neural network to solve the regression problem generally has only one output node, and the output value of this node is the predicted value.

L2\nAlthough they also make the absolute value of the parameter smaller, they actually do slightly different things:\n\nL1 makes the absolute value of the parameter smaller by subtracting a fixed value for every update\nL2 makes the absolute value of the parameter smaller by multiplying by a fixed value less than 1 for every update.\n\nDropout\n\nDuring training, each time before updating the parameters, we do sampling for each neuron (also including the input layer). Each neuron has a p% chance that it will be discarded (dropout). If it is lost, the weight connected to it will also be lost.\nThe parameters between different networks are shared.\nAssuming that during training, the dropout rate is p%, all weights learned from the training data must be multiplied by (1-p%) to be used as the weight of the testing set.\n\nWhat Dropout really wants to do is to make your results on the training set worse, but the results on the testing set are better.Dropout is a optimization method for testing set but is used for training .\nIf the type of network is very close to linear, the performance of dropout will be better, and the network of ReLU and Maxout is relatively close to linear, so we usually use the network with ReLU or Maxout in Dropout.\nMaxout V.s. Dropout\nMaxout is that the network structure corresponding to each data is different, and Dropout is that the network structure is different for each update (each minibatch corresponds to an update, and a minibatch contains many data)\nParameter Initialization\nWhat should be the scale of this initialization? If we choose large values for the weights, this can lead to exploding gradients. On the other hand, small values for weights can lead to vanishing gradients. There is some sweet spot that provides the optimum tradeoff between these two, but it cannot be known a priori and must be inferred through trial and error.\nIn general, it is a good idea to avoid presupposing any form of a neural structure by randomizing weights according to a normal distribution.\nXavier Initialization\nXavier initialization is a simple heuristic for assigning network weights. With each passing layer, we want the variance to remain the same. This helps us keep the signal from exploding to high values or vanishing to zero. In other words, we need to initialize the weights in such a way that the variance remains the same for both the input and the output.\nThe weights are drawn from a distribution with zero mean and a specific variance. For a fully-connected layer with m inputs:\nW_{ij} \\sim N\\left(0,\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\nThe value m is sometimes called the fan-in: the number of incoming neurons (input units in the weight tensor).\nHe Normal Initialization\nHe normal initialization is essentially the same as Xavier initialization, except that the variance is multiplied by a factor of two.The weights are still random but differ in range depending on the size of the previous layer of neurons. This provides a controlled initialization hence the faster and more efficient gradient descent.\nFor ReLU units, it is recommended:\nW_{ij} \\sim N\\left(0,\\frac{2}{m}\\right)\nBias Initialization\nThe simplest and a common way of initializing biases is to set them to zero.\nOne main concern with bias initialization is to avoid saturation at initialization within hidden units — this can be done, for example in ReLU, by initializing biases to 0.1 instead of zero.\nPre-Initialization\n This is common for convolutional networks used for examining images, which is to be used on similar data to that which the network was trained on.\nFeature Normalization\nmanipulate the data itself in order to aid our model optimization\n\nmin-max normalizationrescaling the range of features to scale the range in [0, 1] or [−1, 1].\nAs this has a tendency to collapse outliers so they have a less profound effect on the distribution.\nx^\\prime = \\dfrac{x-\\min(x)}{\\max(x)-\\min(x)}\n\nFeature standardization\nmakes the values of each feature in the data have zero-mean and unit-variance,which ameliorate the distortion (uniforming the elongation of one feature compared to another feature)\nx^\\prime = \\dfrac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\n\nBatch Normalization\nBatch normalization is an extension to the idea of feature standardization to other layers of the neural network.\n\nTo increase the stability of a neural network, batch normalization normalizes the output of a previous activation layer by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation.$\\mu$ is the vector of mean activations across mini-batch, $\\sigma$ is the vector of SD of each unit across mini-batch.\nH^\\prime = \\dfrac{H - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\mu = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\sum_iH_i\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{m}\\sum_i(H - \\mu)_i^2+\\delta}\n\nBatch normalization allows each layer of a network to learn by itself more independently of other layers.\n\nHowever, after this shift/scale of activation outputs by some randomly initialized parameters, the weights in the next layer are no longer optimal. SGD ( Stochastic gradient descent) undoes this normalization if it’s a way for it to minimize the loss function.\n\nConsequently, batch normalization adds two trainable parameters to each layer, so the normalized output is multiplied by a “standard deviation” parameter (γ) and add a “mean” parameter (β). In other words, batch normalization lets SGD do the denormalization by changing only these two weights for each activation, instead of losing the stability of the network by changing all the weights.

These values are the most intuitive when represented as numbers; they’re strictly ordered, and a difference between various values has a strict meaning. \n\nStating that package A is 2 kilograms heavier than package B or that package B came from 100 miles farther away than package A has a fixed meaning, no matter whether package A weighs 3 kilograms or 10, or whether B came from 200 miles away or 2,000. \n\nIf you’re counting or measuring something with units,the value probably is a continuous value.\nNext are ordinal values. The strict ordering of continuous values remains, but the fixed relationship between values no longer applies.  \n\nA good example is ordering a small, medium, or large drink, with small mapped to the value 1, medium to 2, and large to 3. The large drink is bigger than the medium, in the same way that 3 is bigger than 2, but it doesn’t tell you anything about how much bigger. If you were to convert 1, 2, and 3 to the actual volumes (say, 8, 12, and 24 fluid ounces), those values would switch to interval values. It’s important to remember that you can’t do math on the values beyond ordering them; trying to average large=3 and small=1 does not result in a medium drink!\n\nFinally, categorical values have neither ordering nor numerical meaning. These values are often enumerations of possibilities, assigned arbitrary numbers. \n\nAssigning water to 1, coffee to 2, soda to 3, and milk to 4 is a good example. Placing water first and milk last has no real logic; you simply need distinct values to differentiate them. You could assign coffee to 10 and milk to –3 with no significant change (although assigning valuesin the range 0..N-1 will have advantages when we discuss one-hot encoding later).\n\n"},"pytorch/real_data_representaion.html":{"url":"pytorch/real_data_representaion.html","title":"real world data representation","keywords":"","body":"real world data representation\nPyTorch tensors are homogeneous, information in PyTorch is encoded as a number, typically floating-point.\nOne-hot Encoding\nAchieve one-hot encoding by using the scatter_ method, which fills the tensor with values from a source tensor along the indices provided as arguments\ntarget_onehot = torch.zeros(target.shape[0], 10)\ntarget_onehot.scatter_(1, target.unsqueeze(1), 1.0)\n\nThe arguments for scatter_ are\n\nThe dimension along which the following two arguments are specified\nA column tensor indicating the indices of the elements to scatter\nA tensor containing the elements to scatter or a single scalar to scatter(1,in this case)\n\nThe second argument of scatter_, the index tensor, is required to have the same number of dimensions as the tensor you scatter into.

This submodule contains the building blocks needed to create all sorts of  neural network architectures. Those building blocks are called modules in PyTorch parlance (and layersin other frameworks)  \nA PyTorch module is a Python class deriving from the nn.Module base class. A Module can have one or more Parameter instances as attributes, which are tensors whose values are optimized during the training process.\nNOTE The submodules must be top-level attributes, not buried inside list or dict instances! Otherwise, the optimizer won’t be able to locate the submodules (and, hence, their parameters). For situations in which your model requires a list or dict of submodules, PyTorch  provides nn.ModuleList and nn.ModuleDict.\nAll PyTorch-provided subclasses of nn.Module have their call method defined, which allows you to instantiate an nn.Linear and call it as though it were a function.\nTorch.nn.Linear\nCLASS torch.nn.Linear(in_features, out_features, bias=True)\nnn.Linear, a subclass of nn.Module, which applies an affine transformation to its input (via the parameter attributes weight and bias)\nParameters :\n\nin_features –  the number of input features ,or say, size of each input sample(or tensor) (i.e. size of x)\nout_features – the  number  of  output  features, or say, size of each output sample(or tensor) (i.e. size of y)\nbias – whether the linear model includes a bias. If set to False, the layer will not learn an additive bias. Default: True  \n\nNote that the weights W have shape (out_features, in_features) and biases b have shape (out_features). They are initialized randomly and can be changed later (e.g. during the training of a Neural Network they are updated by some optimization algorithm).\nCalling an instance of nn.Module with a set of arguments ends up calling a method named forward with the same arguments. The forward method executes the forward computation; call does other rather important chores before and after calling forward. So it’s technically possible to call forward directly, and it produces the same output as call, but it shouldn’t be done from user code.\nweight, which obtains from nn.Module, has the shape of [out_features,in_features]. \n\nout_features is the number of network neurons in this layer.\nin_features is the number of neurons in the previous network layer.\n\nbias, which also comes from nn.Module, has the shape of [out_features]\nNote  To accommodate multiple samples, modules expect the zeroth dimension of the input to be the number of samples in the batch. You can provide an input tensor of size B x Nin, where B is the size of the batch and Nin thenumber of input features.\nOptimizer\nlinear_model = nn.Linear(1,1)\noptimizer = optim.SGD(linear_model.parameters(),lr=1e-2)\n\nYou can ask any nn.Module for a list of parameters owned byit or any of its submodules by using the parameters method. This call recurses into submodules defined in the module’s init constructor and returns a flat list of all parameters encountered.\nNow you don’t pass params explicitly to model because the model itself holds its Parameters internally.Loss functions in nn are stillsubclasses  of nn.Module,  so  create  an  instance  and  call it  as  a  function.

No matter how nested the submodule is, any nn.Module can access the list of all  child  parameters.\nNOTE Child modules contained inside Python list or dict instances won’t be registered automatically!

If wanting to keep the number of channel, the effect of a 1×1 convolution is that it just adds nonlinearty, even it also can can increase the number of channel.\nInterpretations of the ResNet\nWe can actually drop some of the layers of a trained ResNet and still have comparable performance.A ResNet architecture with i residual blocks has 2**i different paths (because each residual block provides two independent paths).It is quite clear why removing a couple of layers in a ResNet architecture doesn’t compromise its performance too much — the architecture has many independent effective paths and the majority of them remain intact after we remove a couple of layers.It is apparent that the distribution of all possible path lengths follows a Binomial distribution.The ResNet did not solve the vanishing gradients problem for very long paths, and that ResNet actually enables training very deep network by shortening its effective paths.\nInception Network\nBase idea: concatenate all the outputs, and let the network learn whatever parameters it wants to use, what the combinatins of these filter size are at once.

Because its rate of decline is fast for it takes exponential operation. Only when two points are extremely closed, their similarity will be great.

Pruning neuron off\nThe difference between weight and neuron pruning is that pruning off a neuron is equivalent to cutting off the entire column of a matrix. But as a result, the speed will be faster. Because the overall matrix becomes smaller after neuron pruning. But the weight pruning remains the same size, with many holes.\nKnowledge Distillation\nWe firstly train a large/Teacher network ,and then train a small/Student network to mimic large network. For example, train a large network to recognize image. We got 70% for \"1\", 20% for \"7\", 10% for \"9\".

For example, not only label but also information that \"1\" is similar to \"7\" does teacher network teache to student network.More advanced usage : Knowledge Distillation helps to merge your ensemble models into a model. It would learn from all ensemble network. Usually we average outputs of all ensemble network, and student network just to learn to produce the same output.\nParameter Quantization\n\nUsing less bits to trepresent a value\nWeight clustering\nRepresent frequent clusters by less bits, represent rare clusters by more bits. e.g. Huffman encoding\nBinary connectBinary weights : your weights are always $+1$ or $-1$.At first, randomly initial weight , and then search for nearest binary weight, calculate its gradient as gradient for updating. \n\nArchitecture Design\n\nLow rank approximationIntervene a linear layer between network layers to reduce parameters\nDepthwise Separable Convolution\nDepthwise Convolution\nfilter number = input channel number\nEach filter only considers one channel\nThe filters are $k×k×1$ matrices\nThere is no interaction between channels\nUsing these filters to do one-on-one convolution operation onto different channel of origin image respectively\n\n\nPointwise ConvolutionTo consider relationship between channels, using several 1×1×＃channel filters to perfom convolution.The each value of output of each neuron coms from pointwise convolutin onto the intermediate output of filter(step 1).The function of intermediate output is similar to low rank approximation.At last, the parameters will reduce a lot.\n\n\n\nDepthwise Separable Convolution v.s.

This reflects the asymmetry in Bayesian inference, which starts from a prior $Q$ and updates to the posterior $P$.

Harvard's NLP team specially produced the corresponding PyTorch's Guide Notes.\nCheck the \ntransformer structure image\nA High_Level Look\nWe first treat the entire model as a black box. For example, in machine translation, a sentence in one language is received as input, and then it is translated into other languages ​​for output. \nTake a closer look, it consists of encoding components, decoding components and the connection layer between them.\n\nThe encoded part of the model is a stack of encoders, and the decoded part of the model is a stack of the same number of decoders\n\nThe input of the encoder first enters a self-attention layer, which helps the encoder to see other words in the input sequence when encoding a word\nThe output of self-attention flows to a feedforward network, and the feedforward network corresponding to each input position is independent of each other.\nThe decoder also has these sub-layers, but an attention layer is added between the two sub-layers, which helps the decoder to pay attention to the relevant part of the input sentence.\n\nBringing The Tensors Into The Picture\nLet's analyze the most important part of the model, starting with Vectors/Tensors, and observe how they flow through each component and output.\nAs a common example of NLP application, first convert the input word into a vector using embedding algorithm\n\nThe vectorization of words only occurs at the input of the lowest encoder, so that each encoder will receive a list (each element is a 512-dimensional word vector), but the input of other encoders is the output of the previous encoder. The size of the list is a super parameter that can be set, usually the length of the longest sentence in the training set.\nAfter vectorizing the input sequence, they flow through the following two sublayers of the encoder.\n\nA key feature of Transformer can be seen here, the word at each position only flows through its own encoder path. In the self-attention layer, these paths are interdependent. The forward network layer does not have these dependencies, but these paths can be executed in parallel when flowing through the forward network\nNext, we give a simple example, and then look at what happens in each sublayer of the encoder\nNow We’re Encoding!\nAs mentioned earlier, the encoder receives the input of the vector list and feeds it into self-attention, then feeds it into the forward network, and finally passes the input to the next encoder\n\nThe word vectors at each position in the figure above are fed into the self-attention module, followed by the forward network (the exact same network structure for each vector).\nSelf-Attention at a High Level\nTake the following sentence as an example, as the input sentence \"The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired\" that we want to translate. What does \"it\" mean in the sentence? Does \"it\" mean \"street\" or \"animal\"? Very simple question for humans, but not simple for algorithms\nWhen the model deals with the word \"it\", self-attention allows the connection between \"it\" and \"animal\".\nWhile the model works with words in each position, self-attention allows the model to focus on other position information in the sentence as auxiliary information (cues) to better encode the current word\nTransformer uses Self-attention to encode the \"understanding\" of related words in the current word\n\nAs we use #5 encoder to encode The word 'it', part of the Attention will focus on The word 'The Animal' and incorporate some of its representation into The encoding of the word 'it'\nAttentional mechanisms\nIn the original paper, Google showed a general definition of attention mechanism, that is, it is a coding sequence scheme like RNN or CNN. An attention function can be described as mapping query and a set of key value pairs to output, where query, key, value and output are vectors. The output can be calculated by the weighted sum of the values, and the weight assigned to each value can be calculated by query and the compatibility function of the corresponding key.\nIn translation tasks,Query can be regarded as the original word vector sequence, while Key and Value can be regarded as the target word vector sequence. The general attention mechanism can be interpreted as calculating the similarity between Query and Key, and using this similarity to determine the attention relationship between Query and Value. In order wors, the operation between Query and Key is equivalent to calculating the internal similarity of the input sequence, and paying attention to the internal connection of the sequence itself (Value) based on this similarity or weight. This internal connection may be that the subject notices the information of the predicate and object or other structures hidden in the sentence.\nScaled Dot Product AttentionThe input is composed of Query and Key vector whose dimensions are $d_k$, and Value vector whose dimension is $d_v$. We will first calculate the dot product of Query and all Keys, and divide each by squre_root(d_k) to prevent the product result from being too large, and then feed it to the Softmax function to obtain the weight corresponding to Value. With these weights, we can configure the Value vector to get the final output.\nAttention(Q,K,V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V\n\nMore detials about Scaled Dot Product AttentionIn the above formula, the dot product of Q and K will be divided by squre_root($d_k$) to achieve scaling. The author of the original paper found that when the dimension $d_k$ of each Query is relatively small, the performance of dotted attention and additive attention is similar, but as $d_k$ increases, the performance of additive attention will exceed the dotted attention mechanism. However, dot multiplication attention has a powerful property, that is, it can use the parallel operation of matrix multiplication to greatly speed up training.The author of the original paper thought that the reason of the poor effect of dot product attention was that when $d_k$ is relatively large, the product result will be very large, so it will cause Softmax to quickly saturate and only provide a very small gradient to update the parameters. So they adopted the square root of $d_k$ to reduce the dot product result and prevent the Softmax function from saturating.In order to prove why the magnitude of the dot product becomes very large, we assume that the vector $Q$ and $K$ are both independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1, and their dot product $Q⋅K=\\sum_iq_i \\cdot k_i$ has 0 mean and the variance $d_k$. To counteract this effect, we can normalize the dot product result by dividing by squre_root($d_k$).\n\nSelf-Attention in Detail\nLet's first look at how to calculate the self-attention vector, and then look at how to calculate it in a matrix.\nFirst step, according to the input vector of the encoder (in this example, each word Embedding Vector), generate three vectors, for example, for each word vector, generate Query-vector, Key-vector , Value-vector. The generation method is to multiply the three matrices $W^Q, W^K, W^V$, these three matrices need to be learned during the training process. Note: Not every word vector has 3 matrices, but all inputs share 3 conversion matrices;\nNote: the dimensions of these new vectors are smaller than those of the input word vector (512 dimension is converted to 64 dimension), which is not necessary, but to make the calculation of multiheaded attention more stable\n\n\nq : query(to match others)$q^i = W^qx^i$\nk : key(to be matched)$k^i=W^kx^i$\nv : information to be extracted$v^i = W^vx^i$\n\nMultiplying $X_1$ by the $W^Q$ weight matrix will result in $q_1$, which is the query vector associated with the word. We finally created a \"Queries\", a \"Keys\" and a \"Values\" projection for each word in the input sentence.\nSecond step, in fact, we calculate Self-attention is to calculate a score. For example, for the sentence \"Thinking Matchines\", when we calculate the score for \"Thinking\", we need to calculate the \"evaluation score\" of each word in the input sentence for the current word \"Thinking\",  this score determines the encoding \" Thinking\", how much attention each input word needs to focus on the current word set.\nThe score of the current word is obtained by performing a dot product of the query-vector corresponding to \"Thinking\" and the key-vecor of all words in the sentence. So when we deal with the word at position #1 (\"Thinking\") in the sentence, the first score is the dot product of q1 and k1, and the second score is the dot product of q1 and k2.\n\nSteps 3 and 4, divided by 8 ($=\\sqrt{d i m_{k e y}}$), so the gradient will be more stable. Then add the softmax operation and normalize the scores so that all are positive and the sum is 1.\na_{1,i}=\\dfrac{q^1\\times k^i}{\\sqrt{d}}\n\nThe softmax score determines the degree of expression (attention) of each word in the sentence at this position. Obviously, the word in this position should have the highest softmax score.\nStep 5, multiply the softmax score by value-vec bit by bit. Keep the value of the word of interest and weaken the value of non-related words (for example, multiply them by decimals such as 0.001).\nSixth step, add all the weighted vectors to produce the output of self-attention at that position.\nz^1 = \\sum_i\\hat{a}_{1,i}v^i\n\nThe above is the calculation process of self-attention, and the generated vectors flow into the forward network. In practical applications, the above calculations are performed in the form of a matrix which speeds up. Below we look at the matrix calculation at the word level.\nMatrix Calculation of Self-Attention\nFirst step, calculate Query/Key/Value matrix, and merge all input embedding vector into input matrix X (each row of input matrix X represents a word vector of input sentence), And multiply it by our weight matrix after training**$W^Q,W^K,W^V$. (In the figure below, we can see the input embedding vector size X [512 dimensions, represented by four small squares], and the output vector Q/K/V [64 dimensions, represented by three small squares])\n\nFinally, since we are dealing with matrices, we can combine steps 2 to 6 into a formula for calculating the output of the self-attention layer, as shown below\n\nTIPS All $z^1,z^2,\\cdots$ can be parallelly computed. Merge all input vectors $x^1,x^2,\\cdots$ to an ensemble vector $I$. And then multiply it with $W^q,W^k,w^v$ to generate $Q,K,V$ matrix for query, key, value matrix.\nQ = I \\times W^q\nK = I \\times W^k\nV = I \\times W^v\nA = K^T\\times Q\n\\hat{A} = \\operatorname{softmax}(A)\nZ = V \\times \\hat{A}\nMulti-head Attention Mechanism\nThe following figure shows the Multi-head Attention structure used in Transformer, which is actually multiple dot product attentions that are processed in parallel and finally stitched together. Generally speaking, we can perform h different linear transformations on the three input matrices $Q, V, K$, and then put them into h dot product attention functions and concatenate all the output results.\nMultihead Attention\nMulti-head Attention allows the model to jointly pay attention to different representation subspace information at different positions. We can understand it as performing dot product attention multiple times without sharing parameters. The expression of Multi-head Attention is as follows:\nMultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(Head_1,\\cdots,Head_h)W\nHead_i = Attention(QW_i^Q,KW_i^K,VW_i^V)\nWhere $W$ is the weight matrix corresponding to the linear transformation, and Attention() is the dot product attention function mentioned above.\n\nIn the original paper, the researcher used $h=8$ parallel dot product attention layers to complete Multi-head Attention. For each attention layer, the dimension used in the original paper is $dk=d_v=\\dfrac{d{model}}{h}=64$. Since the dimensionality of each parallel attention layer is reduced, the total computational cost is very similar to the cost of a single dot multiplication attention in the full dimension.\n\nTransformer uses Multi-head Attention in three different ways. First of all, in the encoder to decoder level, the Query comes from the output of the previous decoder, and the memorized Key and Value come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to pay attention to all positions in the input sequence, so it actually mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanism in the sequence-to-sequence model.\nSecondly, the encoder layer contains the self-attention layer, and all Value, Key, and Query in this layer are the same input matrix, which is the output of the previous layer of the encoder. Finally, the self-attention layer in the decoder allows every position in the decoder to notice all legal positions including the current position. This can be achieved by the Mask function, thereby preventing left-direction information flow to maintain autoregressive properties.\nMulti-head Attention in Detail\nBy adding a mechanism called multi-headed Attention, this paper further improves self-attention, which can improve the performance of Attention in two ways: \n\nMulti-headed expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions in the sentence. In the above example, $z_1$ contains very little information about other words, and is only determined by the actual word. In other cases, such as the translation of \"The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired\", we want to know what the word \"it\" refers to.\nMulti-headed gives the attention layer multiple representation subspaces. As shown in the following example, there are multiple sets of Query/Key/Value-matrix under the multi-headed attention layer, not just one set (8-heads are used in the paper, each head has a set of Q/K/V matrix). Each group is randomly initialized, and after training, the input vector can be mapped into different sub-expression spaces.\n\n\nIf we perform the same self-attention calculation above, there are eight different sets of weight matrices (Q/K/V), and finally we will get eight different Z matrices.\n\nThis is a bit of a hassle, because forward networks cann't accept eight matrices at a time, but want the input to be one matrix, so there's a way to deal with combining eight matrices into one matrix.\nWhat shall we do? We merge the matrix, and then multiply the combined matrix by another weight matrix $W_o$\n\nThe above is the content of the multi-head self-attention mechanism. I think it is only a part of the matrix. Let's try to visualize them as follows.\n\nNow that we know about \"Attention Heads,\" let's revisit the example from the previous section to see what the different \"Attention Heads\" focus on when encoding the word \"it\" in the example sentence\n\nWhen encoding \"it\", one attention head is concentrated on \"the animal\" and the other head is concentrated on \"tired\". In a sense, the expression of the model for \"IT\" synthesizes animal and tired.. If we put all the attention heads into the picture, it is difficult to explain intuitively\n\nRepresenting The Order of The Sequence Using Positional Encoding\nSo far, we have not discussed how to understand the order of words in input sentences\nTo solve the problem of word order, Transformer add a new vector for each word. These vectors follow a specific pattern for the model to learn to determine the position of the word or the distance between different words in the sequence. An intuitive understanding, after adding these vectors to the embedding vector, once they are projected into the Q/K/V vector. In dot-product attention, they can provide meaningful distance or location information between the embedding vectors.\nIn order for the model to keep the word order, we add a positional encoding vector that follows a particular pattern.\n\n如果我们假设嵌入的维数为4，则实际的位置编码应如下所示：\n\nWhat does a designated pattern look like?\nIn the figure below, each line corresponds to the position code of a vector. Therefore, the first line will be the embedded vector that we want to add to the first word in the input sequence. Each row contains 512 values. Each value is between 1 and -1. We have color-coded them to visualize the pattern. (Figure: A real example has 20 words, each with 512 dimensions. You can observe the significant separation in the middle, because the left side is generated with the sine function and the right side is generated with cosine)\n\nThere is not only one method for position coding. Note that the encoding method must be able to handle sequences of unknown length.\nIn the original paper, researchers use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies :\nPE_{(pos,2i)} = sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}})PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}})\nWhere pos is the position of the word, and i is the i-th element of the position encoding vector. Given the position pos of the word, we can map the word to a position vector of $d_{model}$ dimension, and the i-th element of the vector is calculated by the above two formulas. In other words, each dimension of the position code corresponds to a sine curve, and the wavelength constitutes a geometric sequence from $2π$ to $10000⋅2π$.\nThe position vector of the absolute position is constructed above, but the relative position of the word is also very important. This is the subtlety of the trigonometric function used by Google researchers to represent the position. The sine and cosine functions allow the model to learn the relative position based on two transformations:\nsin(α+β)=sinα cosβ+cosα sinβ \ncos(α+β)=cosα cosβ−sinα sinβ \nFor a fixed offset $k$ between words, the position vector $PE(pos+k)$ can be represented by the combination of $PE(pos)$ and $PE(k)$, which also represents the relative position between languages.\nThe Residuals Connection\nOne detail worth noting in the encoder architecture is that in each sub-layer (FFNN), there are residual joins, and these are closely followed by layer-normalization\n\nIf we visualize vector and layer-norm operations, it will look like this:\n\nFeed-forward network by Position\nIn order to pay attention to the sub-layers, each encoder and decoder module finally contains a fully connected feedforward network, which is applied independently and identically to each location. This feedforward network contains two linear transformations and a nonlinear activation function, and we can add a Dropout method between the two layers of the network during the training process:\nFFN(x) = \\max(0, xW_1 + b_1 )W_2 + b_2\nIf we combine these two fully connected networks with residual connection and layer normalization, then it is the last necessary sub-layer for each encoder and decoder module. We can express this sub-layer as : \nLayerNorm(x + max(0,xW_1+b_1)W_2+b_2)\nAlthough the linear transformation is the same in all different positions, it uses different parameters in different layers. This transformation can actually be described as two convolutions with a kernel size of 1.\nBatch Norm v.s. Layer Norm\n\nBatch Norm : same dimension at different channelsBatch normalization is to consider the input data of a neuron in mini-batch, calculate the average value and variance, and then use this data to normalize the input of each training sample.\n\nLayer Norm : different dimension at same channels of a layerThe input data of the same layer are considered, and the mean value and variance are calculated to normalize the input data of each layer.The formula for calculating the layer normalized statistics for all hidden cells in the same layer is shown below :\nh^t = f\\lbrack \\frac{g}{\\sigma^t} \\odot (a^t -\\mu^t) + b\\rbrack\n\\mu^t = \\dfrac{1}{H}\\sum_{i=1}^Ha_i^t\n\\sigma^t = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{1}{H}\\sum_{i=1}^H(a_i^t - \\mu^t)^2}\n$h^t$ represents the output of hidden layer t, $a_i^t$ represents the i-th input of the hidden layer t, $g$ is the gain parameter that scales the normalized activation before the nonlinear activation function. $\\beta$ is bias.\nLayer normalization can greatly reduce the covariance deviation problem by correcting the mean and variance of the activation values in each layer.\n\n\nBatch Norm is applied on batch and normalizes on NHW, which is more often used on CV task. As different channels have different important features, different channels perfom different normalization. Same batches in the same channel do the same normalization. However, Layer Norm is applied on channal and normalizes on CHW, which more frequently used on NLP task. It can be regarding as sequence length. So layer norm normalizes on the words among in a sequence of sentence, while batch norm normalized on same locatoin amone a channel. More importantly, the length of sequence can vary and channel can't be consistent, so Layer norm can apply it to sentence by sentence.\nThe sub-layer of the decoder is similar to this structure. Assume that our model is a Transformer composed of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, as shown in the following figure:\n\nThe Decoder Side\nNow that we have understood most of the concepts on the encoder side, we also have a basic understanding of how the decoder works. Let's see how they work together.\nThe encoder starts from the processing of the input sequence, and the output of the last encoder is converted into a set of attention vectors K and V, which are used by the \"encoder-decoder atttention\" layer of each decoder to help the decoder focus on the appropriate position of the input sequence\nAfter encoding, it is the decoding process; each step of decoding outputs an element as the output sequence.\n\nThe following steps are repeated until a special symbol appears to indicate that the decoder has completed the translation output. The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, and the decoder outputs the corresponding decoding result at each step like the encoder. In addition, just as the input of the encoder does, a position vector is added to the input of the decoder to indicate the position of each word.\nThe self-attention layer in the decoder is slightly different from the self-attention layer in the encoder:\nIn the decoder, before performing softmax operation, unknown output is achieved by occluding future positions (setting them to -inf). The self-attention layer only allows paying attention to the position earlier than the current output.\nThe \"Encoder-Decoder Attention\" layer works in the same way as multi-headed self-attention, except that it gets the output from the front layer and is converted into a Query matrix. And it receives the key and value matrix of the last layer encoder as the key and value matrix of current decoder.\nThe Final Linear and Softmax Layer\nThe decoder finally outputs a floating-point vector, how to convert it into words? This is the main work of the final linear layer and softmax layer.\nThe linear layer is a simple full connection layer that maps the final output of the decoder to a very large logits vector\nAssuming that the model knows 10,000 words (output word list) learned from the training set, the logits vector has 10,000 dimensions, each value representing the possible tendency value of a certain word. The softmax layer converts these scores into probability values (all positive, and the sum is 1), and the word on the dimension corresponding to the highest value is the output word of this step.\n\nCompared with the scores in the range of $(-\\infty,+\\infty)$, the probability is naturally better interpretable, so that subsequent threshold operations can be completed smoothly (dimensionality is not involved after normalization).\nThrough the full connection layer, we get the score within the range of K categories $(-\\infty,+\\infty)$ logits, which is called $Z_j$. In order to get the probability of each category, we first map the score to $(0,+\\infty)$ through $e^{Z_j}$, and then normalize it to (0,1). Softmax thought is to rely on the calculation dependency of the loss function\n\\hat{y}_j = \\operatorname{softmax} \\left(z_j \\right) = \\frac{e^{z_j}}{\\sum_{k} e^{z_j}}\n\n\nThe figure starts at the bottom and uses the resulting vector as the output of the decoder part, and then converts it to an output word\nRecap Of Training\nNow that we have understood the forward process of a fully trained Transformer, during training, the model will undergo the forward process described above. When we train on the labeled training set, we can compare the predicted output with the actual output.\nFor visualization purposes, assume that the output has a total of six words (a, am, I, thanks, student, )\nThe output vocabulary of our model is created during the preprocessing stage, even before training has started.\n\nOnce the word list is defined, we can construct a vector of the same dimension to represent each word, such as one-hot encoding. The following example encodes \"am\"\n\nWe discuss the loss of the model, the indicators used to optimize in the training process, and guide the learning to get a very accurate model.\nThe Loss Function\nLet's demonstrate the training with a simple example, such as translating \"merci\" to \"thanks\". That means that the probability distribution of the output points to the word \"thanks\", but since the model is not trained and initialized randomly, it is unlikely to be the expected output.\nThis means that we want the output to be a probability distribution representing the word \"thanks\". However, since the model has not been trained, it is unlikely to happen at present.\n\nSince the model parameters are initialized randomly, the untrained model outputs random values. We can compare with the real output, and then use error backward to adjust the model weights so that the output is closer to the real output.\nHow to compare two probability distributions? Simplely adopt cross-entopy or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Since this is an extremely simple example, the more real situation is to use a sentence as input. For example, the input is \"je suis étudiant\" and the expected output is \"i am a student\". In this example, we expect the model to output a continuous probability distribution that meets the following conditions:\n\nEach probability distribution has the same dimensions as the vocabulary. (The dimension in the current example is 6, but in practice it is generally 3000 or 10000)\nThe first probability distribution has the highest predicted probability value for \"i\"\nThe second probability distribution has the highest predicted probability value for \"am\"\nUntil the fifth output points to the \"end of sentence\" tag, the symbol also has cells related to the 10,000 element vocabulary\n\nWe will train a sample sentence for the target probability distribution in the training example.\n\nAfter training the model on a large enough data set for enough time, we hope to generate the probability distribution as follows:\nAfter training, the output of the model is the translation we expect. Of course, this does not mean that the process is coming from the training set. Note that every location has a value, even if it has little to do with the output\n\nNow, because the model only produces one set of output per step, it is assumed that the model chooses the highest probability and discards the other parts. This is a method of generating prediction results called greedy decoding.\nAnother way to do it would be to hold on to, say, the top two words (say, ‘I’ and ‘a’ for example), then in the next step, run the model twice: once assuming the first output position was the word ‘I’, and another time assuming the first output position was the word ‘a’, and whichever version produced less error considering both positions #1 and #2 is kept. We repeat this for positions #2 and #3…etc. This method is called “beam search”, where in our example, beam_size was two (because we compared the results after calculating the beams for positions #1 and #2), and top_beams is also two (since we kept two words). These are both hyperparameters that you can experiment with.\nAnother method is beam search. Each step only keeps two outputs with the highest probability. According to these two outputs, the next step is predicted, and new two outputs with high probability are retained. Repeat until the end of prediction.\nBeam search is only used for prediction (if greedy is used for prediction, one misstep could ruin all). Only use greedy when training, because in the training process, the output of each decoder has the corresponding correct answer as a reference, so there is no need for beam search to increase the accuracy of the output.\nSummary\nAdvantages:\n\nAlthough Transformer ultimately does not escape the traditional learning routine, the transformer is only a combination of full connection (or one-dimensional convolution) and Attention. However, its design is innovative enough, because it has abandoned the most fundamental RNN or CNN in NLP and achieved very good results. \nThe key of Transformer's design to bring the greatest performance improvement is to set the distance between any two words to 1, which is very effective for solving the difficult long-term dependence problem in NLP. \nThe parallelism of the algorithm is very good, which is in line with the current hardware (mainly GPU) environment.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nAlthough rudely abandoning RNN and CNN is very dazzling, it also makes the model lose the ability to capture local features. The combination of RNN + CNN + Transformer may bring better results. \nThe location information lost by Transformer is actually very important in NLP, and adding Position Embedding to the feature vector in the paper is only an expedient measure, and it does not change the inherent defects of Transformer structure.\n\n"},"transformer/variant_of_transformers.html":{"url":"transformer/variant_of_transformers.html","title":"Variant of Transformers","keywords":"","body":"Variant of Transformers\nSandwich Transformer\nQuestion : Could we increase the performace just by reorder the sublayer module?Answer : Of couse!\nDesigning a better transformer\n\nmodels with more self-attention toward the bottom and more feedforward sublayers toward the top tend to perform better in general.\nNo extra parameters, memory requirement.\n\nCombination way of Sandwich Transformer\n$sssssssfsfsfsfsfsfsfffffff$ \nLength of Sandwich Coefficient is 6, which leads to better performance.\nUniversal Transformer\nResidual Shuffle Exchage Network\n\nFewer parameters compare to other models for the same tasks.\nSequence processing in 0(n log n) Time, specialize application on long sequence.\nShuffle & Exchange operators capture distant informations replace attention.\n\n"},"conditional_generation_by_RNN_&_Attention/conditional_generation_by_RNN_&_Attention.html":{"url":"conditional_generation_by_RNN_&_Attention/conditional_generation_by_RNN_&_Attention.html","title":"Conditional Generation by RNN & Attention","keywords":"","body":"Conditional Generation by RNN & Attention\nGeneration\nGenerating a structured object component-by-component\n\nSentences are composed of characters/words\nGenerating a character/word at each time by RNN\n\n\nImages are composed of pixels \nGenerating a pixel at each time by RNN \n\n\n\nConditional Generation\n\nWe don't want to simply generate some random sentences.\nGenerate sentences based on conditions.\nRepresent the input condition as a vector, and consider the vector as the input of RNN generator.\nSequence-to-sequence learning\nEncoder : represent the input condition\nDecoder : generate the conditional output\nJointly train\n\n\n\nProblem : how to consider longer context during chatting\nAttention - Dynamic Conditional Generation\nWhy need dynamic conditional generation?\n\nSometimes our input features are complex and hard to be encoded into a vector\nLet every single decode considers essential encoded information which is required at different single time \nFocus on local dependent input feature \n\nMachine Translation\nAttention-based model\nBase Idea : \n\nIntroduce a match function to match output $h^n$ of hidden layer of input features through RNN with another vector $z^m$(initial by a NN or simply a vector) to produce an according output $\\alpha_m^n$, and then let them through a softmax layer.\nAt last, we combine all the output $\\hat{\\alpha}_n^i$ of softmax layer \nc^k = \\sum \\hat{\\alpha}_k^nh^n\nwhich is our decoder input \n |input feature|RNN|hidden output|match vector|match function||softmax layer||matrix multiplication||add up|decoder input|\n |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n |机|$\\rightarrow$|$h^1$|$z^0$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\alpha_0^1$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\hat{\\alpha}_0^1$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\hat{\\alpha}_0^1h^1$|$\\rightarrow$|$c^0$|\n |器|$\\rightarrow$|$h^2$|$z^0$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\alpha_0^2$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\hat{\\alpha}_0^2$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\hat{\\alpha}_0^2h^3$|$\\rightarrow$||\n |学|$\\rightarrow$|$h^3$|$z^0$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\alpha_0^3$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\hat{\\alpha}_0^3$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\hat{\\alpha}_0^3h^3$|$\\rightarrow$||\n |习|$\\rightarrow$|$h^4$|$z^0$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\alpha_0^4$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\hat{\\alpha}_0^4$|$\\rightarrow$|$\\hat{\\alpha}_0^4h^4$|$\\rightarrow$||\n From above, we could attain effective information block which remains its origin information makes decode perfom better.

Represent same sentences with two kinds of different vectors ($x$ and $h$ vector) which can jointly learn. One to calculate match score and the another to perform weighted sum with $\\alpha$. In addition, extracted information can add up to query vector to update. The afore mentioned process can repeat multiple times. At last, feed the extracted information into DNN to produce output.\nNeural Turing Machine\nNeural Turing Machine can not only read information from memory but also modify the memory through attention.  \n\nGiven a set of memory $m_0^1,m_0^2,m_0^3$, a vector sequence.\nGiven a sef of Attention weight $\\hat{\\alpha}_0^1,\\hat{\\alpha}_0^2,\\hat{\\alpha}_0^3,\\hat{\\alpha}_0^4$\nWeighted sum to extract information\nr^0 = \\sum \\hat{\\alpha}_0^im_0^i\nFeed $r_0$ and first input $x^1$ into controller function and then it will output three vectors $k^1,e^1,a^1$ which can controll memory and attention.\n\n$k^1$ : the function of this vector is to generate attention\\alpha_1^i = \\cos(m_0^i,k^1)We generate new match score $\\alpha$ after previous step such as $\\alpha_1^1,\\alpha_1^2,\\alpha_1^3,\\alpha_1^4$.

In this case, what decoder can output depends on the input.Pointer Network can apply on machine translation and chat-bot because it can identify proper noun such as person's name even there are not sample in training data.\n"},"unsupervised_learning/unsupervised_learning.html":{"url":"unsupervised_learning/unsupervised_learning.html","title":"Unsupervised Learning","keywords":"","body":"Unsupervised Learning\n\nClustering & Dimension Reduction\nGeneration\n\n"},"unsupervised_learning/dimension_reduction.html":{"url":"unsupervised_learning/dimension_reduction.html","title":"Dimension Reduction","keywords":"","body":"Dimension Reduction\nClustering\n\nK-means\n\nClustering $X = \\lbrace x^1,\\cdots,x^n,\\cdots,x^N \\rbrace$ into K clusters\nInitialize cluster center $c^i,i=1,2,\\cdots,K$ (K random $x^n$ from $X$)\nRepeat\nFor all $x^n$ in $X$ :$b_i^n = \\begin{cases}\n  1, & x^n\\quad is\\quad most\\quad \"close\"\\quad to\\quad c^i \\\n  0, & Otherwise\n  \\end{cases}$\nUpdating all $c^i$ :$c^i = \\dfrac{\\sum{x^n}b_i^nx^n}{\\sum{x^n}b_i^n}$  \n\n\n\n\nHierarchical Agglomerative Clustering(HAC)\n\nStep 1 : build a tree according to their degree of similarity\nStep 2 : pick a threshold to cluster node\n\n\n\nClustering v.s.

So it can't deal with non-linear dimension reduction.\n\nFAQ\nQuestion : How many principal components?Solution : To calculate variance of each principal components based on its eigenvalue, consider the big eigenvectors and ingore the small eigenvectors.\nQuestion : What happens to PCA?Answer : It is worth noting that the components may not be parts of digits(suppose it's a MNIST task) as weight can be any real number. PCA involves adding up and subtrcting some components.Another technology is NMF(Non-negative matrix factorization). PCA can be regard as a SVD(Singular Value Decomposition) opration on data matrix, while the decomposed value can be positive or negative.
